**Dr. Andrea (Andi) Carlson**, an economist in the Food Markets Branch of the Food Economics Division in USDA’s Economic Research Service, researches food prices, with an emphasis on their impact on healthy diets and organic food purchases. She is the project lead for the Linkages project which allows users to import nutrient and food composition data into USDA’s purchased scanner data and estimate individual food prices for dietary intake data. Her research interests include the affordability of healthy diets, tracking consumption over time, and examining organic food purchases and price premiums. Dr. Carlson joined ERS after 9 years with USDA’s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) where she was the project leader for the USDA Food Plans, CNPP Food Prices Database, and a major contributor to the Cost of Raising a Child.
